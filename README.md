# GANs

### DCGAN
* Implemented DCGAN - generator and discriminator architecture with training following pytorch
tutorials.
* Written in Object-Oriented Design rather than jupyter notebook used in the tutorial.
* Trained using custom dataset having aerospace component images prepared at my lab to visualize
the working and how generated images are improving with each epoch.
